# Windows Auto Hotspot üöÄ

**Windows Auto Hotspot** is a PowerShell script that automatically manages your PC's **Wi-Fi hotspot**. It enables the hotspot when an Ethernet cable is connected (including via USB adapters) and disables it when disconnected. Follow the steps below to configure and automate the process using **Task Scheduler**.

### How Does It Work? ü§î

**Windows Auto Hotspot** automates the process of turning your PC into a Wi-Fi hotspot whenever an Ethernet cable is connected. The script runs in the background, activating the hotspot when a wired connection is detected, and disabling it when the cable is unplugged. This eliminates the need for manual management‚Äîit's all done automatically.

### Why Ethernet? üåê

This script works exclusively with Ethernet connections. It is designed for environments where your primary internet access is through a wired connection, ensuring seamless sharing via your PC‚Äôs Wi-Fi.
### Perfect for Laptop Users üíª

Laptop users will find this script especially useful. If you prefer to close your laptop lid and still keep the hotspot running, you can adjust your system settings to ensure the laptop doesn't go into sleep mode while plugged into power. This allows the hotspot to continue operating even when the lid is closed, making it an ideal solution for keeping your devices connected without interruptions.

For example, you can configure your laptop to stay awake when connected to power, allowing you to use it as a permanent hotspot while keeping it out of the way‚Äîno need to keep the screen open or active.

### Key Advantages üîë
- **Fully Automated**: The script starts automatically with the system and activates the hotspot when an Ethernet cable is detected.
- **Ethernet-Exclusive**: It only works with Ethernet connections, perfect for homes and offices that rely on wired internet.
- **Optimized for Laptops**: You can close your laptop lid without putting it to sleep, allowing the hotspot to keep running while plugged into power.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Runs silently in the background and adjusts the hotspot as needed.

Whether you're working in an Ethernet-only environment, need a reliable and automated hotspot solution for your laptop, or just want to ensure all your devices stay connected, **Windows Auto Hotspot** is the perfect solution.
